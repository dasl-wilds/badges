WILDS Badges
============

WILDS will and does have publicly available code in varying states of usability, development, and support. We think it's important to get code in users hands early and often to make sure we're solving users needs; given that situation, we want to clearly communicate that the software may not be stable yet. On the other extreme software may no longer be maintained, and we want to have a standard way to communicate about that as well.

Software maintainers often achieve this communication about the status of a piece of software using a simple badge at the top of the landing page for the software.

For the majority of documentation about WILDS badges see <https://getwilds.github.io/badges/>
