<p>DaSL will and does have publicly available code in varying states of usability, development, and support. We think it’s important to get code in users hands early and often to make sure we’re solving users needs; given that situation, we want to clearly communicate that the software may not be stable yet. On the other extreme software may no longer be maintained, and we want to have a standard way to communicate about that as well.</p>

<p>Software maintainers often achieve this communication about the status of a piece of software using a simple badge at the top of the landing page for the software.</p>

<p>This set of badges is adapted from Repostatus.org.</p>

<h2 id="repo-statuses">Repo Statuses</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a name="concept"></a><strong>Concept</strong> – Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.</li>
  <li><a name="wip"></a><strong>WIP</strong> – Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.</li>
  <li><a name="suspended"></a><strong>Suspended</strong> – Initial development has started, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release; work has been stopped for the time being but the author(s) intend on resuming work.</li>
  <li><a name="abandoned"></a><strong>Abandoned</strong> – Initial development has started, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release; the project has been abandoned and the author(s) do not intend on continuing development.</li>
  <li><a name="active"></a><strong>Active</strong> – The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.</li>
  <li><a name="inactive"></a><strong>Inactive</strong> – The project has reached a stable, usable state but is no longer being actively developed; support/maintenance will be provided as time allows.</li>
  <li><a name="unsupported"></a><strong>Unsupported</strong> – The project has reached a stable, usable state but the author(s) have ceased all work on it. A new maintainer may be desired.</li>
  <li><a name="moved"></a><strong>Moved</strong> - The project has been moved to a new location, and the version at that location should be considered authoritative. This status should be accompanied by a new URL.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-it-looks-like">What It Looks Like</h2>

<p>When using the recommended method (a badge embedded in your project’s README file), it’s as concise as this one image:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/getwilds/badges/#active"><img src="/badges/active.svg" alt="Project Status: Active – The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed." /></a></p>

<p>This incorporates three components:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The image URL, which serves as the machine-readable status identifier. It points to a status-specific image hosted on getwilds.org.</li>
  <li>Alt-text on the image (this can generally be viewed in a browser by mousing over the image) which begins with the canonical project status (“Project Status: <status name="">") and can optionally be followed by a human-readable description of the status, provided by the project's maintainer(s). Such text might also be useful to appear after the badge.</status></li>
  <li>The image is linked back to the particular status description at <a href="https://github.com/getwilds/badges">https://github.com/getwilds/badges</a>.</li>
</ol>
