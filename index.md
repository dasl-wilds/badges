* <a name="active"></a>__Active__ – The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.

## What It Looks Like

When using the recommended method (a badge embedded in your project's README file), it's as concise as this one image:

[![Project Status: Active – The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://getwilds.github.io/badges/active.svg)](https://github.com/getwilds/badges/#active)

This incorporates three components:

1. The image URL, which serves as the machine-readable status identifier. It points to a status-specific image hosted on getwilds.org.
2. Alt-text on the image (this can generally be viewed in a browser by mousing over the image) which begins with the canonical project status ("Project Status: <status name>") and can optionally be followed by a human-readable description of the status, provided by the project's maintainer(s). Such text might also be useful to appear after the badge.
3. The image is linked back to the particular status description at <https://github.com/getwilds/badges>.
